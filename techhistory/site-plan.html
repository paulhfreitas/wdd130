      <h3>The History</h3>
      <h4>The History of Computers</h4>
      <p>
        The history of computers dates back to the early 1800s when Charles Babbage designed a calculating machine called the Difference Engine. This was followed by the invention of the first programmable computing machine in the 1940s, the Digital Delay Storage Automatic Calculator. In the 1950s, the first commercial computer, the IBM 701, was introduced, followed by the first personal computer, the Commodore PET, in 1977. In the early 2000s, the popularity of smartphones and tablets increased which resulted in the transition of computer technology to a more user-friendly digital era.

      <h3>What the Future Holds</h3>
      <p>
        Computers will continue to get faster, smaller and more powerful as technoligical advances are made. Artificial intelligence and robotics will become increasingly prevalent in our society, performing more tasks that we currently do ourselves. We may even see the beginnings of quantum computing, which would offer an exponentially larger data processing capacity. The internet of things, connecting all of our devices, will become more prominent in our lives. Enhanced virtual and augmented reality will also become commonplace, allowing us to experience more interactive, immersive experiences.
        In the future, computers will play a major role in everyday life. They will assist with our day-to-day tasks, from shopping to scheduling. Artificial intelligence will be widely integrated, making devices like cars and phones smarter and more efficient. Smart houses will be the norm, allowing us more control of our living environment. We'll also be able to access vast amounts of information quickly, through voice recognition and augmented reality software. That will open up new possibilities for education and communication. Computers are poised to shape the future in many positive ways.
	Imagine if someday technology advances and we are able to control computers with the power of our minds. It would be amazing! We could operate machines and devices with the power of our thoughts. It could revolutionize work and leisure, making doing things much easier. We could communicate easier, and have access to information at the speed of thought. It would be a great advancement for mankind, and would make a big difference in our daily lives.
