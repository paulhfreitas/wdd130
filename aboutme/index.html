    <h1>Paul</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Paulo Freitas, you can call me Paul. I'm from Brazil and I'm currently pursuing a bachelors degree in Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>I love learning languages, spending time in nature, and watching movies/TV shows during my free time. </p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church my whole life and I served a full-time mission in Durban, South Africa. 
    I love the endless possibilities of technology, so I decided to pursue a degree in Applied Technology. I work with music production and graphic designing. I also own a small business and manage it through an e-commerce website.</p>
    <p>I bought a theme for my website and decided to edit and make it user-friendly and aesthetically minimalistic. That's when I found CSS and HTML. 
    Without them, editing a theme is limited to the options offered by the editing platform. I only know how to take information from developer tools, edit it, and add it as custom CSS. This course will help me not just customize but build a whole website from scratch.</p>
